# Maps Javascript API Project Demonstration

This project is a remix from a template option.  I have chosen to 
use the Maps Javascript API to show the locations of the road 
schedule for the Chicago Bears Football team.

The Stadium images are simply to show the location within the city identified in the top banner.
